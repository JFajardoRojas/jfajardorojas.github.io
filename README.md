My name is Fernando Fajardo-Rojas, and I am a PhD student in Materials Sciences at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/) under the advice of [Diego Gómez-Gualdron](https://chemeng.mines.edu/project/gomez-gualdron-diego/). I am part of [ID4 - Institute for Data Driven Dynamical Design](https://www.mines.edu/id4/) where I integrate molecular simulations, high-throughput computing, and machine learning methodologies to explore and identify novel materials with potential for energy-related applications.

Here, you will find information about my research interests, publications, and more.

## Research Interests

My primary research interests lie in the field of Computational Materials Sciences. I am particularly interested in using computational modeling and simulation techniques to study the properties and behavior of materials at the atomic scale. Some specific areas of focus include:

- Molecular dynamics simulations
- Machine Learning
- Materials design and discovery
- Surface Phenomena
