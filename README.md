I am a Ph.D. candidate in Materials Sciences at [Colorado School of Mines](https://www.mines.edu/), working under the guidance of [Dr. Diego GÃ³mez-Gualdron](https://chemeng.mines.edu/project/gomez-gualdron-diego/). I am part of [ID4 - Institute for Data Driven Dynamical Design](https://www.mines.edu/id4/) where I integrate molecular simulations, high-throughput computing, and machine learning to explore and identify novel materials with potential for energy-related applications.

## Research Interests

My broad research interests lie in the intersection between physics, chemistry, and machine learning to design functional materials. Among my research interests are:

- Development of Data-Driven tools for Rational Materials Design
- Multi-Scale Property-Structure Relationships for Complex Systems Design
- Interfacial Phenomena
- Porous Materials

## News
