## Projects

### Project 1: Materials Design for Energy Storage

As part of my research, I have been involved in a project focused on developing new materials for energy storage applications. We utilized computational methods to screen and design materials with improved energy storage capabilities. The project involved collaboration with researchers from different disciplines and resulted in promising findings.

### Project 2: Nanomaterials for Catalysis

In collaboration with a team of researchers, I worked on investigating the catalytic properties of nanomaterials for various industrial applications. We used computational simulations to understand the underlying mechanisms and optimize the performance of these materials. The project contributed to the development of more efficient catalytic systems.
