    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. student in Materials Sciences at <a href="https://www.mines.edu/">Colorado School of Mines</a>, working under the guidance of <a href="https://chemeng.mines.edu/project/gomez-gualdron-diego/">Dr. Diego GÃ³mez-Gualdron</a>. I am part of <a href="https://www.mines.edu/id4/">ID4 - Institute for Data Driven Dynamical Design</a> where I integrate molecular simulations, high-throughput computing, and machine learning to explore and identify novel materials with potential for energy-related applications.

## Research Interests

My broad research interests lie in the intersection between physics, chemistry, and machine learning to design functional materials. Among my research interests are:

- Development of Data-Driven tools for Rational Materials Design
- Multi-Scale Property-Structure Relationships for Complex Systems Design
- Interfacial Phenomena
- Porous Materials

## News 

- 04/2024: I was honored with the ID4 Excellence Award 2024. The award is granted based on intellectual merit, broader impacts, and ID4 community building. I am happy to share this honor with great scientists and friends. [Link](https://www.mines.edu/id4/news-and-events/)
- 08/2023: [New Collaboration Paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.3c03918): Three solution-stable MOFs were found to facilitate the Singlet Fission process by stabilizing the Charge Transfer state.
- 06/2023: I participated in the seminar sessions of [ID4](https://www.mines.edu/id4/) sharing my work on Application-relevant properties predictions in MOFs using Machine Learning.
- 05/2023: [Collaboration Paper](https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CY00404J): We studied the synthesis of H2O2 with Pd and PdO. I explored Pd-PdO clustered configurations using reactive force fields looking for non-biased structures.
- 05/2023: We organized a workshop for professional development with [ADSE](https://www.allianceinscience.org/) at TAMU
